# graphics-python
A .py project featuring the graphics module.
The program creates a window with the game where the user needs to choose (by clicking) a particular path represented by a white circle.
There is only one correct path and by choosing it the user is granted one additional 'life'. Otherwise one life is subtracted.
3 lives are given in the beginning. The game depends on luck since the correct path is determined randomly.
There is no end to this game, only 'Game Over' screen once 0 lives are left.
This program was written for the college course on Python as an assignment utilizing graphics.
